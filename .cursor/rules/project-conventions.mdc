# Project Conventions

Common code and file conventions for this project.

## Code / File Conventions

- **File names and code**: Write in English
- **Comments**: English only
- **Variable/function names**: English
- **Commit messages**: English, conventional commits format

## 6-Phase Workflow

Every feature/task MUST follow 6 phases in order:

```
Phase 1: Requirements -> Phase 2: Design (Diagrams) -> Phase 3: Edge Cases
-> Phase 4: Implementation (TDD) -> Phase 5: Debug -> Phase 6: Release
```

NEVER skip phases. NEVER start coding before Phase 3 is complete.

## Rule Priority

- Specialized rules in `.cursor/rules/` override this file
- Example: For diagram creation, follow `diagram-specialist.mdc`

## References

- **Skills list and usage**: `.cursor/SKILLS-INITIALIZATION.md`
- **Detailed rules**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
